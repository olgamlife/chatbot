# Olgam Plasma Donation Complete Knowledge Base

## About Olgam Life
### Company Information
- **Founded by**: A team of individuals on a mission to save the lives of millions of patients who need plasma
- **Services**: Olgam Life ONLY offers plasma donation services, NOT blood donation
- **Important**: If asked about blood donation, clarify that Olgam does not have a blood donation service - only plasma donation. For blood donation, individuals must check with blood donation centers.

## First-Time Donor Experience

### What to Expect During First Visit
Your first donation takes approximately 2 hours and includes:
- Completing a Donor History Questionnaire
- Basic screening tests (blood pressure, pulse, temperature)
- Brief health examination to ensure donation safety
- Venipuncture (needle insertion) and connection to donation machine
- Automatic payment loading onto pre-paid debit card after successful donation

First-time donors can donate the same day after completing paperwork and health screening. No appointment is necessary - walk-ins are welcome at any time until the center's closing time.

### Required Documentation
All first-time donors must bring three items:
1. Current, unexpired ID (government-issued photo ID, driver's license, or valid US passport)

### Physical Experience
Most donors describe the needle feeling as a mild sting. A finger stick test is required each time to evaluate protein and hemoglobin levels. The donation process is performed in a highly controlled, sterile environment by professionally trained medical staff, with all collection equipment being single-use only.

Common but temporary side effects may include:
- Fatigue
- Dizziness
- Lightheadedness

It's important to rest, hydrate, and eat a nutritious meal after donation. Contact medical staff for any severe or persistent side effects.

3. After friend completes 2 donations at any Olgam Life center
4. $50 bonus deposited into your account after your next donation following their second donation
5. No limit on number of referrals

### Example
Sarah donates at any Olgam Life center and refers Jake, who donates at any Olgam Life location. As long as Jake mentions Sarah's name before his first donation and donates twice, Sarah gets $50 after her next donation.

### Referral Checklist
To receive your $50 referral bonus, your friend must:

- Complete two donations at any Olgam Life center
- You must donate again after their second donation to receive your bonus

## Use of Donated Plasma

### Medical Applications
- Helps save lives of patients worldwide
- Used for treating autoimmune diseases:
  - Hemophilia
  - Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID)
  - Von Willebrand Disease
- Processed through plasma fractionation to separate individual proteins for pharmaceutical therapies
- Cannot donate plasma for a specific family member (directed donation is not available)
- **IMPORTANT: Olgam ONLY accepts plasma donations, NOT blood donations or platelet donations**

### Plasma vs. Whole Blood
- **Olgam Life specializes in plasma donations ONLY, not whole blood**
- Plasma is the yellow liquid part of your blood, made mostly of water, proteins, and nutrients. It carries hormones, removes waste, and helps with clotting and immunity. Your body naturally replenishes it, making regular donation safe.
- **For whole blood donation, donors must visit a blood donation center - Olgam does NOT offer blood donation services**
- Cannot donate plasma for a specific family member
- You can donate both plasma and whole blood at different facilities, but must follow the waiting periods between donations
